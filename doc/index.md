Welcome to Emboss, the Embedded Systems Binary Structure Tool.

If you are new to Emboss, a good place to start would be the [User
Guide](guide.md).

The [C++ User Guide](cpp-guide.md) has an (incomplete) explanation of the
generated C++ code.

Details of the Emboss language can be found in the [Emboss Language
Reference](language-reference.md).

A reference to the C++ code that Emboss generates can be found in the [Emboss
C++ Generated Code Reference](cpp-reference.md).

Details of the textual representation Emboss uses for structures can be found in
the [Emboss Text Format Reference](text-format.md).

There is a tentative [roadmap of future development](roadmap.md).
