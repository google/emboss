# Test .emb to ensure that the import system works.
#
# The file imported_genfiles.emb is identical to imported.emb except for the
# [(cpp) namespace] attribute; it is used to ensure that generated .embs can be
# used by the emboss_cc_library build rule.

# These imports intentionally use names that do not match the file names, as a
# test that the file names aren't being used.
